This is a small program I wrote for fun last summer to try to get
re-familiarized with Python, and try to apply artificial neural
networks.  Looking back there are a lot of hilarious problems,
it would be nice to actually get this working.

This program looks at a small list of tickers, fetches their
data, constructs a ANN, backtrains it, and then uses it to
predict the overall change that the stock can expect over this
comming week.

Ultimatley it barely works, and I didn't investigate enough to
find the appropriate weighting and size for the ANN.
